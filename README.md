## Synopsis

This is a simple AJAX viewer for ShirtBase. It is just a demonstration and lacks adding/deleting/updating features at the moment.

## Motivation

This project was created at the same time as ShirtBase as a part of a school project about APIs, their uses and creation.
As ShirtBase is an API server, I decided to write a simple consumer for that API.

## Installation

Put it on a web server. Adjust URLs in apiJson.js to match the URLs of your ShirtBase installation.
